  _storyText: "You were slowly going down the hole that looked like endless route
    of a giant mole. \r\nHardly holding yourself to the sticking out roots and rocks
    how suddendly the wall under feet disappeared sending small pebbels in the abyss.\r\nWith
    your heard beating hard in your ears you could still hear the splashes followed
    almost immediately after.\r\nAn underground stream seemed promissing. Having no
    strength left you released the wall.\r\nYou were standing in warm waters. In a
    dim light you spotted an track going up from the bank of the stream.\r\n\r\nWhat
    would you do next?\r\n\r\n1. Relax and let the stream carry you away\r\n2. Get
    out and climb the track up"
