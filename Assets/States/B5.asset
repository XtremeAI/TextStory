  _storyText: "You managed to reach the crossing a few more meters higher. It does
    not look safe to jump or go back from here at all! But what are ways forward?
    \r\n\r1. I'll climb through the bushy leaves onto the eastern side of the tree.
    This way I can safely make a few more meters up!\r\n2. Balancing on the branch
    you stand try to make your way to the trunk. You won't make any higher but you
    can get close to mysterious opening in the hull!"
