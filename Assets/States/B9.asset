  _storyText: "Wow. What a view! Stunned by the look of the places you know so well
    but that became so small you almost forgot of you goal which was really close!
    You see your missed toy just above your head but you cannot simply reach it with
    your hand. What puzzled you even more - there was no single useful branch more
    to make a tiny step up. What would you do?\r\n\r1. Simply jump to snatch your
    treasure!\r\n2. Crawl up the trunk like a monkey!"
