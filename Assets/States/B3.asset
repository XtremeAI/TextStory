  _storyText: "You are a few meters off the ground on what seems to be the northen
    side on the tree. Where next could you go?\r\n\r1. Back? Huh... Scarry stuff!
    I am going back..\r\n2. Up above your head you can see a lonely solid branch that
    goes up high and away from the trunk. In the distance it meets another branch
    that should bring you much higher and back to the trunk. I feel like this is the
    way!\r\n3. An accending branch to the left, like a liane leeds up around the trunk.
    It looks a safe way up. I'm going there!"
