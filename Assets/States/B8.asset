  _storyText: "Standing that high you can no longer see the ground. You are all covered
    with leaves and tiny tangled branches. How did you come here? You have to risk
    and make you next move. What would it be?\r\n\r1. A fresh air comes from your
    right. Go that way, there you could see where you are and plan your next steps!\r\n2.
    Hold the branch you were standing on and try to go down.  You must have missed
    a better path down below!"
