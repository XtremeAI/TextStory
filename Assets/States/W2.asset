  _storyText: "As you pulled the rope something clang up high activating a hidden
    mechanism of blocks and weights that gently start to pull the rope up. You closed
    your eyes and held to the rope as hard as you can. You opened your eyes when the
    rope stopped moving and ... you could not believe it - you saw your drone hanging
    in front of you! \r\n\r\nCongrats! You were brave and with a good fortune reached
    the goal of the game! Well done!\r\n\r\nPress 'Space' to start over."
