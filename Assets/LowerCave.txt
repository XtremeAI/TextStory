You were slowly going down the hole that looked like endless route of a giant mole. 
Hardly holding yourself to the sticking out roots and rocks how suddendly the wall under feet disappeared sending small pebbels in the abyss.
With your heard beating hard in your ears you could still hear the splashes followed almost immediately after.
An underground stream seemed promissing. Having no strength left you released the wall.
You were standing in warm waters. In a dim light you spotted an track going up from the bank of the stream.

What would you do next?

1. Relax and let the stream carry you away
2. Get out and climb the track up
